# 1. Put the following questions into RMarkdown as headers (or subheaders if you’re making question numbers headings). Be sure to answer the questions underneath each header. 

### a.	What is a basic workflow for reproducible research?  
You gather the data, analyze it, and present the results. The key is to do these things from the get go in a clear and documented way that can be presented clearly via a document, a presentation, or a website, and can be modified easily later.

### b.	What are five practical tips for making research reproducible?
Lifted from Reproducible Research reading this week.

1. Document everything!
2. Everything is a (text) file.
3. All files should be human readable.
4. Explicitly tie your files together.
5. Have a plan to organize, store, and make your files available.

### c.	Give an example of how you might implement each tip. 
1. All code that is run to gather or analyze data can be run from an `.Rmd` file so that a document or presentation can be built from the beginning. You can also gather the session info via `sessionInfo()` so that others can replicate your session.
2. Don't use Microsoft Office or LibreOffice for documentation as they cannot be opened universally.
3. Follow a style guide when you code/document so that you are writing your code in a standardized way that was developed to improve readability. Also write smart comments when you must use confusing code.
4. Use Tie commands to make the figures, data, and diagrams placed in your document explicitly sourced.
5. Use multiple files for data gathering, analysis, and documentation tasks to prevent the creation of a behemoth file that is confusing to wade through. Think the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) but for files.

### d.	Which one of these do you think will be the most difficult?
Personally, documenting everything since as a developer I am used to coding first and asking questions later. However, there is a push in the development world to document earlier in the process.

# 2. Download and complete “air_hist.R” code from the Files Tab on 2DS.  You will build scatter plots using the plot function.

### a.	As described in the “TODO Assignment 2: Question 2a” comment, complete the plot function regarding monthly temperature.
### b.	As described in the “TODO Assignment 2: Question 2b” comment, complete the plot function involving ozone.
### c.	Translate these to RMarkdown and put them in your overall homework RMarkdown file.

```{r Question2A}
plot(x = airquality$Month, y = airquality$Temp, xlab = "Month", ylab = "Temperature", main = "Temperature by Month")
```

```{r Question2B}
plot(x = airquality$Temp, y = airquality$Ozone, xlab = "Temperature", ylab = "Ozone", main = "Temperature vs Ozone")
```

# 3. Download and complete “knit_cars.Rmd” in the Files tab on 2DS
### a.	As described in the “TODO Assignment 2: Question 3a” comment, complete a plot function for Temperature and Pressure
### b.	As described in the “TODO Assignment 2: Question 3b” comment, complete a similar plot function that reverses the two axes.
### c.	This is written in RMarkdown, so just transfer it to your RMarkdown script. 

(NOTE: The todo's were confusing as they both say to use pressure for x and temperature for y. I went with Temp vs Pressure for A and flipped it for B)

```{r pressure_plot, echo=FALSE}
plot(x = pressure$temperature, y = pressure$pressure, xlab = "Temperature", ylab = "Pressure", main = "Temperature vs Pressure")
```

```{r pressure_plot2, echo=FALSE}
plot(x = pressure$pressure, y = pressure$temperature, xlab= "Pressure", ylab = "Temperature", main = "Pressure vs Temperature")
```
